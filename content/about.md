# Hello, World!

This is a site I have made (mostly) to publish the content I want people to read and learn from, and also serves as a median to learn more.

It will be updated with new content whenever I have time and the content to upload, but due to being a basic static site it wont do very much for now.

## Actually about me

I am a 17 year old hobbyist developer who spends his time learning whatever I can. While not the best, I still strive to get better everyday. I learn more about computers everyday while spending my time hosting and running various services like game servers, self built applications, and networking tools.

While most programming I know is self taught, I have taken the Cisco IT essentials available to me.
